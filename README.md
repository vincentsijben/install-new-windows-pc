Following [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMN17-i10Ng).

* If you have a Windows Product Key, make a note of it. The install asks for it later on.
* Follow instructions https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMN17-i10Ng&t=120s (2:00 till 5:51)
* Optional: Use UniGETUI to check current installed apps, so you can install those easier later on. Follow instructions https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMN17-i10Ng&t=351s (5:51 till 7:03)<br>
Installed it through https://www.marticliment.com/unigetui/. I checked 1Password, Discord, Dropbox, Elgato Stream Deck, OBS Studio, VLC.
* Follow instructions https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMN17-i10Ng&t=513s (8:33 till 12:39). Boot from the USB Device. I had to go to BIOS - Boot - Secure mode and set the "OS Type" from "Windows UEFI mode" to "Other OS".
* When installing, click "i dont have a product key" and "Windows 11 Pro".
* The installation process took 11:15 minutes.
* Install official Game-Ready NVIDIA drivers from nvidia's website.
* On the desktop, open the shortcut UWScript and install UniGETUI to install your software.
* Run windows update, download and install updates, restart.
